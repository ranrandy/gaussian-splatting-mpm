# 3D Gaussian Splatting + Material Point Method (MPM)
Reimplementation of the [PhysGaussian](https://xpandora.github.io/PhysGaussian/) paper. Final project of the advanced computer graphics course at Brown. 

*Remark*: our codes are built upon [1].

## Setup
Please refer to the [PhysGaussian's repo](https://xpandora.github.io/PhysGaussian/) for environment setup instructions.

## Data
Some example 3D Gaussian models are in the  `models` folder. You can train more examples by yourself, or get some pre-trained models from [here](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting).

- If you are on Linux, please follow the [3D Gaussian Splatting's instructions](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) to install and run the viewer.

- If you are on Windows, modify the below command to view the scene or object
    ```
    .\viewers\bin\SIBR_gaussianViewer_app -m models\mic --iteration 3000
    ```

## Usage
To run the current version of this code, modify the below command
```
python main.py --config_path configs/chair.json --output_path output/chair_gravity 
```
*remark: cmd arguments have higher priority than config arguments. So, to set a new value for an argument, you can simply add that to the cmd.

## Results
